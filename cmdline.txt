# NOTES:
# 1. A console is available via the gadget USB port. If you have a USB A ->
#    USB A cable, you can power and view console messages with one cable
# 2. To output kernel messages via the UART pines, add "console=serial0,115200".
#    serial0 is magically replaced with ttyAMA0 or ttyS0 depending on the
#    serial port configuration in config.txt.
# 3. To output kernel messages over HDMI, add
#    "console=tty1 fbcon=scrollback:1024k consoleblank=0"
# 4. "dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0" is a default copied over from Raspbian
# 5. If you're experimenting with kernel commandline parameters, it's easist
#    to modify this file on the MicroSD card via your development computer. To
#    make changes permanent, you'll need to override the fwup.conf.
